*Thanks to @Nobody#6477 for code review and feedback!*

### Simple Description:
**Proof of X** *real-time rewards for on-chain events*. 
Proof of X is a platform that provides both real-time verification of, and rewards for, a specified on-chain task. Using Webhooks, we can monitor the Solana blockchain for specific activities. When triggered, our backend mints an NFT to the user memorializing the act and rewarding the user for that task. 

We are launching "Proof of Burn - BONK" for our demonstration in this hackathon. We have a live demo that will mint anybody a Proof of Burn NFT for burning 1M $BONK. Though this process is triggered from any valid on-chain event, we have created a simple [front end for users to burn 1M $BONK](https://sandstorm.amilz.com/).  

### Tracks Chosen & Why:
Track 1 - NFTs: Proof of X utilizes NFTs to provide proof of authenticity of specific on-chain activities. Though the demonstration application is fun and in the spirit of BONK, Proof of X has value beyond the fun. This platform will provide real-world utility for many business applications (e.g., proof of purchase/receipts, marketing, loyatly rewards programs, proof of attendance, etc.). Proof of X uses Helius Webhooks for tracking activity and Crossmint minting API to create and deliver NFTs. 
Track 2 - Bonking with Bonk!: We give anybody who burns > 1M $BONK a free NFT. Automatically. BONK!
Track 3 - Automation: Proof of X automates the verification of on-chain activities and the delivery of NFTs as rewards or receipts for such activities. Proof of X utilizes Helius Webhooks and is evaluating opportunities to leverage Clockwork for future offerings. 

### Pitch Deck: Not available
Live Demo: Go burn 1M $BONK, and you'll get an NFT. That simple! I have created a burn page to do it easily (this front end is separate from the backend that automates your burn verification and NFT minting). [Burn 1M $BONK](https://sandstorm.amilz.com/).
*NOTE! At present, we are limited to top level Burn instructions (not innner instructions) and limited to Burn, not BurnChecked. If you don't know what that means, I'd recommend using the demo link for your burn (or DM me and I can help you figure it out).
